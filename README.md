# swc_behavioural_analysis

Behavioural analysis for SWC course

## Things to do 

 - make ethogramn 
     + quantify nose-to-nose distance 
         * time limit criteria (?)
     + quantify nose-to-genital distance
     + quantify mouse-to-mouse distance 
     + get the orientation of the mouse
     + two mouse orientation relationship
         * angle between body parts, eg. nose-to-nose
     + classify types of behaviour based on distance and orientation
     + calulate speed of animal (?)
     + data visualisation
 - improve location estimation 
     + get all the position estimates 
     + prune through them based on some rule-based method

## How the raw data is organised

# TS Tasks 

 - [ ] obtain and save unfiltered body part location estimate (in progress)
 - [ ] smoothing (coordinates, and maybe distance estimates?) 
 - [ ] plotting position estimate on top of video 
 - [ ] help out with ethogram / beahvioural classification 
 - [ ] write code to visualise ethogram
 - [ ] plot animation of distances over time
 - [ ] save plots in high quality (300 dpi)
    - [ ] save plot comparing filter (time range needs to be better)
 - [ ] export animations to mp4
    - [ ] add time (sec) instead of frames
