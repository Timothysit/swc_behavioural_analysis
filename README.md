## Things to do 

 - make ethogramn 
     + quantify nose-to-nose distance 
         * time limit criteria (?)
     + quantify nose-to-genital distance
     + quantify mouse-to-mouse distance 
     + get the orientation of the mouse
     + two mouse orientation relationship
         * angle between body parts, eg. nose-to-nose
     + classify types of behaviour based on distance and orientation
     + calulate speed of animal (?)
     + data visualisation
 - improve location estimation 
     + get all the position estimates 
     + prune through them based on some rule-based method
